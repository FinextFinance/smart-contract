## The Finext Finance
 A Five-token System

There exists three types of assets in the Finext system. 

- **Finx **: a stablecoin, which the protocol aims to keep value-pegged to 1 US Dollar. 
- **Bonds**: IOUs issued by the system to buy back Finx when price($Finx) < $1. Bonds are sold at a meaningful discount to price($Finx), and redeemed at $1 when price($Finx) normalizes to $1. 
- **Nexus  **: receives surplus seigniorage (seigniorage left remaining after all the bonds have been redeemed).
